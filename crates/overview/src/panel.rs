//! One observer's overview panel within a multi-observer OBS scene (DESIGN.md S3.3 "composite
//! crops"), normalised to the scale this crate's pixel thresholds and `glyph`'s templates assume.
//!
//! A scene tiles several clients' overviews into one frame, and nothing forces them to share a UI
//! scale or window size — the match recordings this was written for show three overviews at row
//! pitches of roughly 47, 38 and 35px against the 43.4px everything here was tuned on
//! ([`REF_ROW_PITCH`]). Glyph matching is fixed-size NCC, so instead of making every threshold
//! scale-aware, each panel is cropped and resampled to the reference pitch and the existing
//! single-panel pipeline (`layout::detect`, `row::read_rows`) runs on that crop unchanged.
