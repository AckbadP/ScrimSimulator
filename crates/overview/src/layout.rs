//! [Distance, Name, Type, Velocity] will be there along with the header row" — so layout detection
//! reads the header text and locates each required column by keyword, wherever it happens to sit
//! and however many other columns (Size, Angular, ...) surround it.
//!
//! Detected once per recording (a static OBS scene, per DESIGN.md S0), then reused to read every
